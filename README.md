# Vehicle-registration

Finally, I have perfected the Srilankan coustmer vehicle registration application using the MERN Stack as a individual project for the SE-Internship program. I required all of this capability. So, I built both the frontend and the backend utilizing Mongo DB, React JS, Express JS, and Node JS in order to manage the CRUD operations and i am using REST API for this project.

##### Web : ReactJS
##### Server: ExpressJS, NodeJs
##### Database: MongoDB

## what are the function included in this project

> + Create a new user account.
> + Register, login to the account.
> + User can create a new vehicle information.
> + Update personal and vehicles information.
> + User can Delete there vehicle Details.


> + Install dependencies for server 
##### `npm install`

> + Install dependencies for client
##### cd client 
##### `npm install`

> + Connect to your mongodb and add info in .config/defult.json and .config/production.json

> + Run the client & server with concurrently
##### `npm run dev`

> + Run the Express server only
##### `npm run server`

> + Run the React client only
##### `npm run client`

##### Server runs on http://localhost:5000 
##### client on http://localhost:3000
